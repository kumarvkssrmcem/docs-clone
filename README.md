This is a google doc clone app

I have used REACT for the front end and for the collaborative feature i have used socket.io
For the texteeditor feature I have used QUILL.

The user can start the server and hop into the document and afterwards share the link with the intended
use to make collaborative inputs to edit the text are in the real time.

To run the code locally download the repository into your local storage

open the folder with code editor and then open the terminal.

Change the terminal location to client and then install the dependencies by typing

npm install

then open the server side in the terminal and install the dependencies by typing

npm install

now start the client side and the server side by running the commands

npm run serverdev on the client side 
AND
npm start on the server side
